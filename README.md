This is a repository of my solutions to advent of code problems with go!  
_(and maybe other projects? i already named the repo aoc, but heck who cares!)_

"[Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like"
### and i would like to add that its a great way to start learning a new programming language!

## Real shit
I just wanted to start learning a real language and escape the hell landscape of javascript/typescript front end nightmare!
